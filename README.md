# Idea Box

## Assignment
Mod 1 - Idea Box

## Summary
### Week 1
In week 1, we built the HTML/CSS for Idea Box and also built out functionality to allow users to:
* View ideas,
* Create new ideas,
* Delete existing ideas,
* Edit ideas,
* Change the quality of ideas, and
* Filter and search by text.

In week 2, we plan to continue to build out requried functionality for Idea Box and working on additional extensions.

### Week 2
In week 2, we finished developing the functionality for Idea Box. We added the following features:
* Filter by importance,
* Display recent ideas and allow user to show more or less,
* Character counter for input fields,
* Disable submit button based on character count, and
* Update ideas for 5 qualities.

We also spent time refactoring our code to follow Turing guidelines, follow DRY principles, use logical operators instead of nested if/else statements, and use arrow functions and array prototypes instead of for loops as much as possible.
